# Fake News Predictor

This repository contains the **Fake News Predictor**, a machine learning project designed to detect and classify news articles as real or fake based on their content. The project utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze textual data, helping combat the spread of misinformation.

## Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and vectorizing news articles.
- Training of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest for classification.
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (if using notebooks) or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries :
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Numpy
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
  


### Dataset
The project requires a labeled dataset of news articles with "fake" or "real" tags. You can either use the provided dataset or download one from sources such as Kaggle.

DATASET : https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv

### Running the Model

1. **Preprocess the data**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF).
2. **Train the model**: Choose between different models like Logistic Regression or Random Forest.
3. **Evaluate the model**: View performance metrics to assess the accuracy and reliability of the prediction.

Run the project in a Jupyter Notebook using the provided `.ipynb` file:
```bash
jupyter notebook FAKE NEWS PREDICTOR.ipynb
```

### File Structure
- `FAKE NEWS PREDICTOR.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage
1. Load the dataset into the notebook.
2. Follow the steps to clean and preprocess the data.
3. Train the classifier and make predictions.
4. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using the provided metrics.

## Model Performance
The predictor's performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the model or add new features, feel free to create a pull request.
